# Chapter 1: Practice with Basics of HTML, CSS, and JS
## Objectives
* Create an HTML document with minimal styling and dynamic behavior


## Overview:
You will create an html document using VSCode HTML Snippets, and add basic styling and basic JavaScript.

Follow the steps, and if you need additional help you can refer to the slides, previous demos, or the `solution` folder.

## Steps:

### Create a basic page with VSCode

1. In your MyWebCourse project, create a new file called `index.html`. 

1. In the empty `index.html` file, type `html` and pause. You should see a menu with options for html templates. Choose the one that is `html:5` - you can refer to the screenshot `choose-template.png` in this directory.

    We will review the structure of this file in upcoming chapters.

1. In `<head>` look for `<title>` modify it's content so that it looks like this:
    ```html
    <title>Basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</title>
    ```

    ### Add some JavaScript

1. After `<title>`, and before the closing `</head>` tag, add opening and closing `<script></script>` tags.

1. Type in the following code, notice as you type, the editor offers autocompletion. Replace XXXX with your first name.

    ```html
        <script>
            function init() {
                document.getElementById("name").innerHTML = 'XXXX';
            }
        </script>
    ```            

1. Modify the `<body>` start tag as shown to include the onload attribute as shown. This will trigger the function called init(), after the rest of the page has been loaded.
    ```html
    <body onload="init()">
    ```

1. In `<body>`, add this line of code, 
    ```html
    <div id="name"></div>
    ```
    Notice the div element has an attribute of id, with a value of name. this is what the JavaScript will target.

1. Save and then open the file in the Chrome browser and check that your name is displayed. You can right-click the html file and choose open in browser, or use the shortcut ALT-B (i you have installed the Open In Browser extension). The first time you use `Open in Browser` you will be prompted for which browser to set as the default.

1. Is the page displaying your name as expected? 

    If not, are there any errors? You can find out by opening the browser dev tools. Right click in the browser and choose Inspect. The brings up the dev tools and may point to possible errors including which line number to focus in on. 

    Make any necessary fixes - make sure your name is displayed before you move on. Ask fellow students or your instructor for help if needed. (answering questions is a great way to learn!)

1. If you did not get a chance to see and correct an error, add one now. Change your function to be named `init2`. Reload the page, and open the browser dev tools (see details in the last step) to see the error message.  Fix the problem and make sure your site is working, then move to the next step.

    ### Add some style with CSS

1. In the `<head>`, add opening and closing `<style>` tags. You can copy the following code, or if typing - see how VSCode recommends autocompletion.

    ```html
    <style>
        div {
            width: 300px;
            padding: 10px;
            border: 1px solid purple;
            background-color: grey;
            color: purple
        }

    </style>
    ```

1. Go back to the browser and reload to see your changes. Your name should now be in a grey box with a purple border.

1. Mark your work as complete.

1. If you are done before others, continue to the Bonus.

## Bonus:

    For those who finish before others and have existing web dev experience, scan through the bonuses and try to complete what you are able to. 

1. Try adjusting values for the CSS colors and sizes and refreshing the browser.

1. In init() hard-code a JS object with your info like this:
    ```js
    me = {name: 'Judy', email: 'judy@karmoxie.com'}
    ```

1. Use `document.elementById()` as above, to now update `name` by using the object. 

1. Create a new div with an id value `email` and use the object to populate the email value.

1. Once both name and email are working, update the object to include an array of your hobbies. 

1. In the HTML create a new div with an id value of hobbies.

1. In `init()` create a string that starts with `<ul>`.

1. Create a loop based on the hobbies array length and during each loop, add to the string a new `<li>` for the current hobby. 

1. Close the string with a `</ul>`
 
1. Use `document.getElementById` to select the hobbies `div`, and use `innerHTML` to populate the `<div>` with the created string.

1. Style the hobbies div font to be bold and the color of your choice.
